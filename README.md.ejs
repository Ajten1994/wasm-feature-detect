# WebAssembly Feature Detection

A small library (~550B gzip’d) to detect which features of WebAssembly are supported in your current browser.

## Installation

```
npm install -g wasm-feature-detect
```

## Usage

```html
<script type="module">
  import { simd } from "https://unpkg.com/wasm-feature-detect?module";

  simd().then(simdSupported => {
    if (simdSupported) {
      /* SIMD support */
    } else {
      /* No SIMD support */
    }
  });
</script>
```

If required, there’s also a UMD version

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/wasm-feature-detect/dist/umd/index.js"></script>
<script>
  wasmFeatureDetect.simd().then(/* same as above */);
</script>
```

## Detectors

All detectors return a `Promise<bool>`.

| Function | Proposal |
| --- | --- |
<% for (let detector of detectors) { _%>
| `<%= detector.func %>()` | [<%= detector.name %>](<%= detector.proposal %>) |
<%_ } %>

## Why are all the tests async?

The _technical_ reason is that some tests might have to be augmented to be asynchronous in the future. For example, Firefox is planning to [make a change][ff coop] that would require a `postMessage` call to detect SABs, which are required for threads.

The _other_ reason is that you _should_ be using `WebAssembly.compile`, `WebAssembly.instantiate`, or their streaming versions `WebAssembly.compileStreaming` and `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming`, which are all asynchronous. You should already be prepared for asynchronous code when using WebAssembly!
